# EDA--AMCAT
Data analysis  with EDA(univariant and Bivariant)
Project Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the AMCAT dataset to uncover patterns and relationships in the data. The objective is to analyze the dataset, clean and manipulate it, and visualize key insights that can assist stakeholders in understanding the employment landscape of engineering graduates.

Dataset
Source: AMCAT dataset
Description: The dataset includes variables related to academic scores, skills, and salary of engineering graduates.
Features:
Salary: The salary of fresh graduates.
Gender: The gender of the graduates.
Specialization: The academic specialization of the graduates.
10percentage: Percentage obtained in 10th grade.
12percentage: Percentage obtained in 12th grade.
collegeGPA: College grade point average.
GraduationYear: Year of graduation.
SkillScores: Scores in various skills such as English, Logical, Quantitative, and technical fields.
Objectives
Data Understanding: Familiarize with the dataset and its features.
Univariate Analysis: Analyze individual features to understand their distribution and characteristics.
Bivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between pairs of features to identify patterns and correlations.
Steps in EDA
1. Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Values: Imputed missing values or dropped rows/columns based on relevance and data integrity.
Removing Duplicates: Ensured no duplicate entries in the dataset.
Outlier Treatment: Identified and handled outliers using appropriate methods.
2. Univariate Analysis
Visualizations: Histograms, KDE plots, and box plots to understand the distribution of numerical features like 10percentage, 12percentage, and collegeGPA.
Statistics: Calculated measures such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
3. Bivariate Analysis
Visualizations: Scatter plots, heatmaps, and box plots to explore relationships between variables.
Correlation Analysis: Performed correlation analysis to identify relationships between numerical features like collegeGPA and Salary.
Key Findings
Univariate Analysis:
10percentage and 12percentage show a normal distribution with slight skewness.
Salary distribution is right-skewed, indicating a few high earners.
Bivariate Analysis:
Strong positive correlation between collegeGPA and Salary.
Gender and specialization show significant differences in salary distributions.
Tools & Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy
Conclusion
The analysis provided insights into the factors affecting the salary of engineering graduates.
Identified key variables that influence salary, which can guide recruitment and career planning.# EDA--AMCAT
